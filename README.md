# RequireJS and BackboneJS Starter
## Get up an running quick

This application is a starting point to design a modular application using RequireJS and BackboneJS - connects to any API (goes with my .NET-API-Boilerplate).

The build.bat file in the hn_build directory has scripts to run to build the application (requires Node to be installed).  There are simple examples of how to write a router, view, and model.  

Feel free to fork and use in your own BackboneJS app!!

Ask me @Cogiva.
